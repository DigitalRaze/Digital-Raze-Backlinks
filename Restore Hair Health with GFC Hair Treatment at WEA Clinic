What is GFC Hair Treatment?
Growth Factor Concentrate (GFC) Therapy is a revolutionary hair regrowth treatment that uses a high concentration of growth factors extracted from your own blood.   
These growth factors stimulate dormant hair follicles, encouraging natural hair regrowth. Unlike traditional treatments, GFC Hair Treatment is a completely safe and non-invasive procedure, making it an excellent alternative to hair transplants.

How Does GFC Hair Treatment Work?
Blood Sample Collection: A small amount of your blood is drawn, similar to a routine blood test.
Processing: The sample is processed using advanced technology to extract a high concentration of growth factors.
Injection into the Scalp: The extracted growth factors are injected into the affected areas of the scalp using micro-needling techniques.
Hair Follicle Stimulation: The injected growth factors activate hair follicles, improving hair density and thickness over time.
The treatment is minimally invasive, painless, and requires no downtime, allowing you to return to your daily activities immediately.
